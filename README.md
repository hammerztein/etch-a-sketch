- How to apply custom style to `color/checkbox/range` input types.
- Event listeners `mouseover` and `change`.
- How to apply toggle effect utilizing boolean logic.
- How to split up functions into smaller sub-functions - to make code easier to read and maintain.
- Event delegation - instead of attaching event listener on each of the squares, attach only one on the parent
